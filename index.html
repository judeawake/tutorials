	<p>"It is not the critics who counts; nor the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,or where the doesr of the deeds could have don them better.The credit belongs to the man whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blod;who strives valiantly; who errs w;who comes short again and again because there is no effort without errors and shortcomings;but who does actualy tries to do the deeds ; who knows great enthusiasm; the great devotion...."</p>

		<h3>(#section1) Section 1</h3>
		<p>All persons who come to know Jehovah God through reading his written Word will sooner or later want to tell other people about it. They learn that God’s will is for ‘all sorts of men to be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.’ (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) Love for Jehovah makes them want to be imitators of him, reflecting his qualities and sharing his outlook. (Eph. 5:1) So they exert themselves to share with others what God’s Word says. This was true not only in the days of the early Christians; it has also been true down through the centuries right to the present. When the apostle Paul was writing to the Romans, he said: “For if you publicly declare that ‘word in your own mouth,’ that Jesus is Lord, and exercise faith in your heart that God raised him up from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.”​—Rom. 10:9, 10.</p>
